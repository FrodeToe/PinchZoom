# forge-pinch-zoom
customized iPad/IPhone/Android pinch zoom touch controls for ForgeViewer

### Goal:

- Pinch zoom sets zoom point to pivot. 
- Rotation is always turntable style. 
- When panning with two fingers the model must not be rotated.

And thisâ€¦
 
viewer.navigation.setPivotPoint({x: -0.7180065711871748, y: -11.258963707247002, z: 0})
 
 
Need to do a `RAYHIT` on mouse up (touch event) to the center of the screen.  Get the result x,y,z , if something 'hit', set  pivot to that x,y,z.

If no hit on mouse up, do not update pivot point.
